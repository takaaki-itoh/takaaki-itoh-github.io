For the time being, I will create my own site and then program.
Past products have been uploaded, and plans will be implemented in the future. It is a personal app to the last. It takes time, but we aim to complete it.
I want to go to android development somehow.

I want to make one web application in php, one desktop application in C #, and something in C ++.
I want to use Laravel in php, but it takes time to use it at this time.
Finally, go to Android development.
All the functions of the app are almost the same for the purpose.

The purpose is to reconfirm what has been done so far and leave the shape.
The rest is a try for something I have never done.
I also want to use Rust to shape something. I also want to try various frameworks.

Because it is not my main business now, it is tight in terms of time. In the end, it's tight because there are many different cases in my main business. I will continue to work hard.



I wrote it in Google translation.
OK?
